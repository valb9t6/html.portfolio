<h1>The Best Movies According to Valentina</h1>
    <h2>Top 3 movies that I rewatch several times a year.</h2>
<hr />
        <h3>It takes two!</h3>
            <p>This is my favourite wholesome kids movie with the Olsen Twins and Kirstie Alley. I watch this movie when I need something calm for my soul and it never disappoints.</p>
        <h3>The Love Punch</h3>
            <p>Emma Thompson is my favourite actress of all times and Pierce Brosnan is one of the most elegant actors on the planet. This cute and funny love story takes you to the South of France and will make you laugh.</p>
        <h3>Mamma Mia 1</h3>
            <p>Yes, a feel good musical. Meryl Streeps comes right after Emma Thompson on my list of well seasoned favourite actresses. I grew up listening to ABBA on long car rides. I used to go on YouTube to watch lyric videos to learn the text. This movie is channelling these moments for me. And again, Pierce Brosnan is part of it...big plus.</p>
